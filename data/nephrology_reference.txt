==========================

CHAPTER 1: CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)
----------------------------------------

1.1 Definition and Staging
Chronic Kidney Disease is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than 3 months, with implications for health. CKD is classified into 5 stages based on GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate):

Stage 1: GFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73m² with kidney damage
Stage 2: GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m² with kidney damage
Stage 3a: GFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73m²
Stage 3b: GFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73m²
Stage 4: GFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m²
Stage 5: GFR <15 mL/min/1.73m² or dialysis

1.2 Common Causes
